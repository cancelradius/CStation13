# CStation13
Rewrite of the popular codebase /tg/ for the cooperative space simulation game Space Station 13, in C++.
# About this project
An independent remake of the /tg/ codebase in a standalone format, from the ground up. This project will focus entirely on recreating baseline simulation elements and net code initially.
